Joe Pizzas!
Joe is running a take-out pizza shop Pizza-R-US that sells 8" round (circle)  and 10" square pizzas. 
1.  a) prompts Joe for the number of round and square pizzas sold in a day. Obviously, the program must ask Joe to input two integer numbers: the number of circle piazza and the number of square pizza sold.

     b) prompts Joe for his estimate of total pizzas sold in that day in square feet (a floating point number).

2. calculates the total pizza sold in square feet for each type (circle and square) and for both types.

3. a) prints out the calculation results such that Joe would know a) the total number of square feet of pizza sold, b) the total number of square feet of round pizzas, and c) the total number of square feet of square piazzas. 

    b) prints the message "Yeah!" if the total pizzas sold is greater than Joe's estimate (from 1.b), otherwise prints "Bummer!". 

Note: single precision floating point arithmetic must be used for round piazzas but integer arithmetic should be used for square piazzas (except the last step when converting the total square inches to square feet), and floating point comparison must be used for 3.b).
